# CODSOFT
CodSoft Data Science Internship Repository. 

## Virtual tasks performed in completion of this internship:

### Task 1:
    * Titanic open source dataset details about individual passengers include of: age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival/ no survival. 
    * Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset
    * Apply Data preprocessing, model fitting, training, and evaluating for best performance.
    * Note: this is a linear problem hence linear models will be applied. For my case, I have applied Decision Tree Classifier and Logistic Regression. Both resulting in 78% accuracy, but Decision Tree Classifier results in better precision and recall in comparision to Logistic Regression.

### Task 2:
    * Movie Rating Prediction with Python
    * Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors.
    * Goal: Analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.
    * Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies
